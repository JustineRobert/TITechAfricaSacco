# TITECHSACCO - MERN STACKS

>Sacco Members Management System using MERN Stack (NodeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB).

1. Create and Manage Sacco Members Profile
2. Apply for a share transfer request
3. Sacco member Loan apply (Release on next update)

More features will be coming in the future... keep watching my updates

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for the server
npm install

# Install dependencies for the client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

You will need to create a keys_dev.js in the server config folder with

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI',
  secretOrKey: 'YOUR_OWN_SECRET'
};
```
